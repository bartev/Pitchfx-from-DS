A question we've been working on centers on pitchers, specifically how they generate value and what additional insights we can pull from how they do what they do. 
For example, we're wondering whether certain profiles are more sensitive to outside influences, more sensitive to random fluctuation, or more prone to sudden changes in ability or skill.
Obviously there are quite a few questions wrapped up in those ideas, but these are the ones we see as the primary targets for a first pass:

-          How do pitchers generate value (in zone vs. out of zone, swings vs. takes, balls in play, frequent weak contact versus occasional hard contact, etc.)?

-          How consistent or predictive is the manner in which they generate it?

-          Do certain profiles lead to more consistent macro performance numbers?

-          Are certain profiles more sensitive to the quality or profile of the opposing batter?

-          Do certain profiles translate better to the AL East?
